‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Disease Prediction with Machine Learning ü§ñü©∫


This repository contains code for a Heart Disease Prediction system using Machine Learning algorithms. The goal is to build a predictive model that can assist in early detection of heart disease based on a set of input features.

-Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the raw dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of features and their correlation with the target variable.

-Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features or create new ones to enhance the predictive power of the model.

-Model Selection: Implement and compare different Machine Learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, etc.

-Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model's performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or randomized search.

-Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

-Deployment: Once a satisfactory model is achieved, deploy it for real-world predictions.
